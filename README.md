Overview: 
Here, I am building my CMS project with Sinatra using the MVC paradigm.

My program is called Kneeslapp

Kneeslapp is an app for all the kneeslappers out there trying to make it by making funnies. What I wanted to do is create an area that the up and coming comedian can use to track and edit their own jokes.
